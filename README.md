# DieMannschaft
A visual analysis of the German National Team's record across the world, taking into account the nationality of the referree and the climate (country). Current through World Cup 2018. All wins in penalty were counted no different to goals during regulation. 

Some country abbreviations were logically constructed because there was no ISO3 available.

Massive thank you to @charleyferrari for the code inspiration
